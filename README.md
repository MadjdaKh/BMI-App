# BMI-App

This simple App calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight and height. The app determines whether the person has normal weight, is overweight, or is underweight, and displays the result accordingly.

## BMI Formula Check
The formula for BMI is:

**BMI** = **weight in kilograms** / (**height in meters** × **height in meters**)

### Example:
If you input `Weight = 55 kg` and `Height = 170 cm`:

**BMI** = 55 / (1.7 × 1.7) ≈ 19.03
